# Argument
A helper for declaring your assumptions about method arguments.

## Motivation


## Inspiration
I had been using [Catel](http://catelproject.com) for some time and after some initial skepticism found their 
[argument checking](https://catelproject.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CTL/Argument+checking) 
extremely useful. In fact I am really convinced that such partial 
[design by contract](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract) at arguments level is even more important for 
such nonrestrictive language as Javascript.
